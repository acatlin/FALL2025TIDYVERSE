## Introduction

This document extends Arutam Antunish’s TidyVerse vignette on the cereal nutrition dataset from Kaggle.
I add two additional analyses:

Average sodium content by manufacturer, using dplyr.

Relationship between sugar and nutritional rating, using ggplot2.

These extensions provide deeper insight into how manufacturers differ nutritionally and how sugar levels impact perceived nutritional value.

# Load the cereal dataset
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cereal <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arutam-antunish/DATA607/refs/heads/main/cereal.csv")
```

## Extension 1: Average sodium content by manufacturer
This extension calculates the average sodium content for each cereal manufacturer.
Using group_by() and summarise(), I compute the mean sodium value for each manufacturer and arrange the results from highest to lowest.

The summary helps reveal which manufacturers tend to produce cereals with higher sodium levels.
```{r}
sodium_by_mfr <- cereal %>%
  group_by(mfr) %>%
  summarise(avg_sodium = mean(sodium, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_sodium))

sodium_by_mfr
```

## Extension 2: Sugar vs Nutritional Rating Plot
This extension explores whether sugar content is related to a cereal’s nutritional rating.
Using ggplot2, I create a scatterplot comparing grams of sugar to nutritional rating and overlay a linear regression trend line.

The chart shows a clear negative relationship: cereals with more sugar tend to have lower nutritional ratings.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(cereal, aes(x = sugars, y = rating)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Sugar vs. Nutritional Rating in Cereals",
    x = "Grams of Sugar",
    y = "Nutritional Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
