  ##Dataset Overview: Recent College Graduates

  **Source:** [FiveThirtyEight GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv)  
  **Original Story:** *The Economic Guide to Picking a College Major* by FiveThirtyEight  
  **Data Origin:** U.S. Census Bureau — American Community Survey (ACS) 2010–2012 Public Use Microdata Series (PUMS)

  ##Description
  The `recent-grads.csv` dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of earnings and employment outcomes for recent college graduates in the United States.     It includes:
    - **Basic earnings metrics**: Median income, income percentiles (25th and 75th), and unemployment rates
    - **Labor force participation**: Employment status and full-time employment rates
    - **Demographic breakdowns**: Gender distribution across majors
    - **Job types**: Share of graduates working in STEM, service, or other fields

  This dataset is ideal for exploring how college major choice impacts early career outcomes.
